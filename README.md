# CULFS - C++ Utilities Library For Strings
CULFS is a small C++ library that provides a small set of additional utilities to manage strings.

### What's in it?
This library provides a class with a set of public funtions allowing the user to perform _special_ operations with strings, such as converting decimal numbers to strings (containing digits and, eventually, a point) and viceversa, repair corrupted characters inside a string (the function called _repairstring_ detects and replaces them automatically) and so on.

### How to use it?
All you have to do, before using the functions, is to initialize the object called _StringToolkit_, which contains all the functions. Note that three of them are private and therefore not accessible but to the functions contained into the object itself.

### What's their syntax?
It would be really unconfortable to write and read it here, so every function is documented inside the library itself, and, as you'll call them, a description will appear providing you all the information you need! **Note: I have personally tested it on CodeBlocks only! If this does not work on your IDE, just open the library file near to the implementation of the function you need information about: you will find a description at the beginning of it.
